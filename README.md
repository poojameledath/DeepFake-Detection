# Deepfake Image Detection

## 1.1 Background Information
Deepfake technology uses artificial intelligence to manipulate images and videos, often to deceive or spread misinformation. Despite its potential benefits, it raises significant concerns, especially around privacy and the spread of fake news. This project aims to develop an AI system to detect deepfake images to preserve the credibility of visual media.

## 1.2 Motivation and Objective
The goal is to create a system capable of distinguishing between real and fake images with high accuracy. This system will help detect manipulated content, ensuring the authenticity of images, preventing cybercrimes, and protecting individuals' privacy. The primary objective is to develop accurate models like CNNs and fine-tune them for deepfake detection.

## 1.3 Schedule and Milestones
- **Day 1-2**: Set goals, research datasets, and finalize metrics.
- **Day 3-4**: Data preprocessing and augmentation.
- **Day 5-7**: Implement VGG and VGGFace models, hyperparameter tuning.
- **Day 8-11**: Implement ResNet50 and DenseNet models.
- **Day 12-15**: Model evaluation, selection, and final report preparation.

### 2.1 Data Acquisition
The dataset consists of 70k real and 70k fake images. These images are split into train (100k), validation (20k), and test (20k) sets.

### 2.2 Training Methodology
Various deep learning models are employed to detect deepfake images:
- **VGG**
- **ResNet50**
- **DenseNet121**
- **Inception**
- **Customized CNN (MesoNet)**

### 2.3 Workflow
1. **Data Acquisition**: Download and split data into training, validation, and test sets.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Resize images, normalize pixel values, and augment the dataset.
3. **Model Training**: Train different models, validate, and fine-tune hyperparameters.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate models using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves.
5. **Deployment**: Deploy the best model for real-world use and create a demo.
